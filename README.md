# Laravel Event Sourcing and Eventstore (lese) Bridge

Or German for `read`. 

TODO

* [ ] Refactor ResolvedEvent to StoredEvent
* [x] Use env connection settings
* [ ] Support reads larger than 4096 events (use yield?)
* [ ] Callbacks for received, processed, failed
* [ ] Callbacks for aggregate stream, aggregate snapshots
* [ ] Support reading from $all stream or a user stream
* [ ] Trait to help aggregates?
* [ ] persist to persistMany instead of other way round
