# Laravel Event Sourcing and Eventstore (lese) Bridge

Or German for `read` which is somewhat applicable to Event Sourcing. It's almost a good name.

This package swaps out the Event and Snapshot storage model for [Laravel Event Souring](https://docs.spatie.be/laravel-event-sourcing/v1/getting-familiar-with-event-sourcing/introduction) with [EventStore](https://eventstore.com/). 

In addition it provides a console command to subscribe to persistent subscriptions to fire events in your application that are from other systems. This can be useful in a microservice architecture.

## Installation

composer require digitalrisks/lese:^1.0

php artisan vendor:publish --provider="DigitalRisks\Lese\LeseServiceProvider" --tag="config"
